## Datasets for the paper analysis

- Word frequency spreadsheet
- Twitter times series output
- Google trends time series output
- RIV Vaccination willingness spreadsheet
- articles.npy contains a subset of the articles used in the study. This should be just enough for you to exercice the 
code (the full text of all articles are subject to copyrights and therefore are not shared...sorry!).
- removed words from the dutch language, and other filtered out terms (for the article clean up process)
